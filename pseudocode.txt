choices array ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

Create function computerPlay
    Randomly return Rock, Paper, or Scissor. This result will be stored in a computerSelection variable later
        How do I randomly return non-number items? Could assign RPS to 1, 2, or 3?
            Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1 to get random number from 1 to 3
        


modulo function to wrap bounds of choices array such that Rock (index 0) beats Scissors (index 2):
        function mod(a, b) {
            const c = a % b;
            return c < 0 ? c + b : c;
            }

Create a function RPS
    Compare playerSelection and computerSelection
        Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock
    Determine winner, return winner
        if choices are the same, return tie
        if (mod(choice1 - choice2, choices.length) < choices.length / 2)
            choice 1 wins
            else, choice 2 wins
    reset computerSelection?

Display winner

Prompt function to play (again)
    Save player input as playerSelection
        toLowerCase(Prompt()) to catch capitalized characters
            choices.indexOf(selection) to return 0, 1, or 2 according to player selection

    if input is QUIT return
